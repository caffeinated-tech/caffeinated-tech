    What I learnt about web development, I have learnt online. It's a fascinating community full of people, from newbies to experts, sharing knowledge and helping one another. I've mostly been a lurker in this community, reading and researching what others have shared. In this blog I want to share what I've learnt, and hopefully someone will stumble across it and find it useful.

    Most of the posts will focus on web development, though there will be pieces on system adinistration, development environments, agile methodologies and hardware.

    I'm compiling a list of definitions used in software development. I can never remember what a term means, or what to call a common paradigm. Google tends to direct me to terse wikipedia pages or stackoverflow questions. To help me remember what idempotent, atomiticity and co. are, I'm posting them here for all to find. I'll include code examples and references to sources for all posts.
