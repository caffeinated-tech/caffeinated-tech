  Galway is known for it's friendly culture and great atmosphere. It also has a thriving technology sector rich with established multinationals and startups. Thanks to this, there are many local technology meetups. If you ever find yourself in Galway, take a look at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cities/ie/galway/tech/">Meetup.com</a> for something to do.

  Back in May we had the very successful Atlantec 2017 conference. I wrote a summary post covering it which you can read <a href="/v/blog/59356793dd45812ac64cf5f3/atlanatec-2017">here</a>. This was the third year and it looks like it will be around next year too, so keep the last weekend in May 2018 free for it!
