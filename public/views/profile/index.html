  Profile

<p>
  My name is Liam Krewer,. I'm a 24 year old software developer from the west of Ireland.  
</p>

<h3>
  Work
</h3>
<p>
  I've been working at <a href="http://onepagecrm.com" target="_blank">OnePageCRM</a> since 2014 as a full stack developer. I mostly work with Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Cucumber, SASS, Coffeescript, jQuery and React.
</p>
<p>
  As with any startup, responsilities jump across job titles. I'm focusing on implementing more agile methodologies, pushing for a high test coverage (mostly feature tests using the Cucumber object model pattern) and splitting out into a microservice based architecture.  
</p>
<p>
  Outside of work I also code in Angular, Node, Express, Java, Cortana and Android. I have some basic experience in C#, C, Assempbly and VHDL.
